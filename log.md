# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 30, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Doing the Practical JavaScript course on Watch and Code. Starting the HTML and DOM section today! I've been doing this course because I want to refresh my memory about JavaScript and really learn to think like a programmer to prepare me for future projects. This course has been recommended to me and it's very good so far. 

**Thoughts:** Got through some exercises that really helped me understand things I hadn't before. 
- How objects and primitives compare and how they're stored in variables.

Example: Here, the object's house color would not change to red! Using these diagrams helped to see the difference between primitive and reference values!

### Day 2: May 1, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the Practical JavaScript course. Learned a very useful tool that will surely help me with all of my projects. THE DEBUGGER! 

**Thoughts:** It's incredible how most javaScript courses don't teach how to actually apply it. Understanding how to interact with the HTML document is so important and so is understanding the chrome dev tools.  


### Day 3: May 2, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: I'm now at 72% on the Practical JavaScript course. Learned about refactoring, something I had never heard of before, all about making the code more readable and organized for humans! Also, not entirely related to coding but I got to watch a webinar titled "Acing Your Interview with Positive Psychology: Q&A with Nico Rose" by Dr. Nico Rose. A perks of being a Google Scholarship alumni!

**Thoughts:** 
About the webinar, I enjoyed it a lot. I've been very interested in Psychology recently (for about a year or so) and there are some tips that I'm going to try to calm myself and prepare for future job interviews. 

### Day 4: May 3, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't continue with the Practical JavaScript course due to technical issues with plnkr.co, so instead I continued with the Basic JavaScript section on #FreeCodeCamp just to refresh my memory on a few concepts. 

**Thoughts:** Not my most productive day.

### Day 5: May 4, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Practical JavaScript course and finished watching a Udacity webinar "Front-end Problem Solving and Debugging Skills with Cameron Pittman". Also read this noteworthy [article](https://medium.com/@samerbuna/the-mistakes-i-made-as-a-beginner-programmer-ac8b3e54c312) about Mistakes beginner programmers make and how to avoid them. 

### Days 6 & 7: May 5 & 6, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday I didn't get to dedicate 1 hour to coding, so I guess I already failed to do the 100 days streek. BUT today I dedicated more time to coding than yesterday to make up for it. Got to 82% on the Practical Javascript course. Got a better grasp at using functions inside other functions.

**Thoughts:** Even thought I failed the challenge on day 6, I still pushed myself to learn a bit on SoloLearn (doing the CSS course there), if I wasn't doing this challenge I probably wouldn't have thought about coding that day. 

### Day 8: May 7, 2018 
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: I'm now 90% into the Practical Javascript course. Understood how we distinguish between Higher Order Functions from the Callback Functions, when we have functions inside other functions.

I now truly understand how event listeners work and how the object and it's properties can be acessed when passing a parameter (ex. event) to the  callback function, for example: 
```
// In Chrome dev tools, when an element is selected on a page you can access it by using $0;
var selectedElement = $0;
  selectedElement.addEventListener ('click', function(event) {
  console.log(event);  
  });
// When that selected element is clicked, the mouseEvents object, which has many useful properties, is logged to the console.
``` 
I also learned about event delegation and why it is preferable to do that opposed to adding multiple of the same event listeners to every child.

**Thoughts:** Today I felt like I learned many new things that are small but important to fully understand JavaScript. Also, the todo list is now a bit more functional. 

### Day 9: May 8, 2018 
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Practical JavaScript Course. Continued with freecodecamp lessons and started a new small project a 'Mad Libs - Harry Potter edition', just for fun. By started I mean: Having the idea, creating the files and starting to write a bit of the HTML and CSS. 

**Thoughts:** The PJS course was pretty good for consolidating my previous knowledge of JS and also for understanding how some methods work and most importantly using the Chrome dev tools & debugger both for understanding what is happening and for fixing issues with the code. The last part of the course still needs reviewing though.

### Day 10: May 9, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the design, content and figuring out how to go about the functionality of the Mad Libs Harry Potter project. 

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I'll hopefully get some of the JS code done and working! Fingers crossed.

### Day 11: May 10, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building 

**Today's Progress**: Made input text live change the text on the page. Learned the difference between using ```getElementsByClassName("className")``` and ```querySelector(".className")``` - so the difference is, when you use ``` getElementsByClassName("className")```  it creates a nodeList (a special array of Nodes) of all elements in the page with that class name, so you'd have to use [0] after the () to correctly use that element. Thanks Google and SlackOverflow! 

**Thoughts:** I got so frustrated because I spent over an hour trying to make a single input change an elemnet on the page, when I hadn't loaded the js file correctly! TYPOS :( 
On top of that I'm feeling the flu coming my way!

### Day 12: May 11, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building 

**Today's Progress**: Practically finished the "Harry Potter Mad Libs" project!

**Thoughts:** Even though I was feverish I got to work on the project all day and it felt awesome to actually make progress for once! Might not be the ideal and most readable code ever but I tried to come up with everything on my own. 

### Day 13: May 12, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Testing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: I don't know how finished it is but I feel like it's at a good enough state that I can finish my Mad Libs project with the world! I then continued with a few Free Code Camp JS lessons as well.

**Thoughts:** Since yesterday I spent the whole day in front of the computer I made sure not to do that today, but I managed to stay productive with the little time I had planned for coding which is awesome. [Promodoro - Tomato Timer](https://tomato-timer.com/) for the win! 

### Day 14: May 13, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Reviewing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: Almost done reviewing the freeCodeCamp JS basics. 

**Thoughts:** I much prefer the format of the Udacity lessons or building things myself, but my goal with freeCodeCamp is to get a refresher on the basics and move on to the advanced Udacity courses, then doing their Algorithms & Projects to get the Front End Dev certification. I wonder if I should be doing this? I just felt so insecure about my JS abilities that I wanted to take on the beginner courses and learn more from different resources before getting myself into more advanced stuff. But I'm finding that I know a lot more than I thought I did, which is a good thing obviously!

### Day 15: May 14, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Reviewing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the FCC JS lessons. Now I know what JSON refers to! Had been hearing about it for a long time but never really looked it up (well, at this stage I still won't need to use it but it's nice to know what it is). 

**Thoughts:** It's getting tricky to do the challenges, this last one really got me... It was the "Profile Lookup" one, the whole accessing objects with arrays on them and using nested loops and if else statements is really challenging.  

### Day 16: May 15, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Reviewing

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Javascript Lessons on FCC. Started "Javascript and the DOM" on Udacity. Also learned how to [make folders](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Creating-new-folders-in-GitHub-repository-via-the-browser) in GitHub from the web browser interface, now I'm saving specific lessons/challenges from FCC for later reference.

**Thoughts:**  It was a good decision to take a look at the Udacity course, now I understand where specific methods and properties came from [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).

### Day 17: May 16, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Planing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: I'm planing/designing my website for Tubbie Arts (for displaying my artwork) - basically it's going to be a custom wordpress theme. So It's gonna be a portfolio website that's a bit more elaborate than the one I've created before (this one will have different pages, and offer the ability to purchase my work). I'm learning more about Wordpress as well. Not so much actual coding today but as I learned previously planning should be part of the workflow of a programmer.

### Day 18: May 17, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't manage to do much. Only started writing the html and organizing sections for the Tubbie Arts website and looked for inspiration and cool ways to make a slideshow for the gallery. 

**Thoughts:** I think there is going to be a key thing missing from the aesthetic of the first version of the website at least, which is the lack of good quality photos of my drawings. Need to take new ones but I don't have a good camera! :sweat: 

### Day 19: May 18, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my gallery website, still no gallery to be seen but the design, menu, css and social media links are looking good-ish. 

**Thoughts:** Absolutely loving the pattern I'm using for the background. Found it on https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/

### Day 20: May 19, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the mobile version of the site (mobile first!) got the mobile menu working, wrote and designed the about page, got the portuguese version of the home and about page done.

**Thoughts:** I've been playing with the border-style properties, don't know if it will stay this way but I think it's interesting that you can use two types of styles in a single image (well actually we can use 4).

### Day 21: May 20, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Just improved a few things on the design of the pages, made the thumbnails for the featured drawings and made the desktop nav bar appear (I started with the mobile version only). 

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately I didn't get the gallery working yet, I'm still weighting options for what to do with the gallery, link to another page when clicking on the thumbnails (where you can see bigger photo(s) of the drawing, information about it and prices for different sizes of prints to purchase? A paypal link for it? Or a simple lightbox type of gallery with the bigger pictures of the drawings with title, simple description and a link to buy it right there?  Now that I've written this out I think it'll be better to have individual pages for each drawing! This whole journaling thing is a great way to have a conversation with myself and clearly see the pros and cons of my ideas. 

### Day 22: May 21, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Using [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) implemented some smooth transitions between pages, made gallery overlay effect using [this example](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) as a guide.

**Thoughts:**  I feel so limited when it comes to JavaScript, I wonder how long till I feel confident enough to make my ideas come to life just like I imagined them. Well, it's not only JS, with CSS there are many things I still haven't understood... One of them is the absolute and relative positioning, and the other is the ::before and ::after things.

### Day 23: May 22, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Made a cross icon appear when closing the menu on mobile, added a new page for pricing and started working on it's content.
