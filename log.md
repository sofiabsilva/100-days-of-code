# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 30, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Doing the Practical JavaScript course on Watch and Code. Starting the HTML and DOM section today! I've been doing this course because I want to refresh my memory about JavaScript and really learn to think like a programmer to prepare me for future projects. This course has been recommended to me and it's very good so far. 

**Thoughts:** Got through some exercises that really helped me understand things I hadn't before. 
- How objects and primitives compare and how they're stored in variables.

Example: Here, the object's house color would not change to red! Using these diagrams helped to see the difference between primitive and reference values!

### Day 2: May 1, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the Practical JavaScript course. Learned a very useful tool that will surely help me with all of my projects. THE DEBUGGER! 

**Thoughts:** It's incredible how most javaScript courses don't teach how to actually apply it. Understanding how to interact with the HTML document is so important and so is understanding the chrome dev tools.  


### Day 3: May 2, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: I'm now at 72% on the Practical JavaScript course. Learned about refactoring, something I had never heard of before, all about making the code more readable and organized for humans! Also, not entirely related to coding but I got to watch a webinar titled "Acing Your Interview with Positive Psychology: Q&A with Nico Rose" by Dr. Nico Rose. A perks of being a Google Scholarship alumni!

**Thoughts:** 
About the webinar, I enjoyed it a lot. I've been very interested in Psychology recently (for about a year or so) and there are some tips that I'm going to try to calm myself and prepare for future job interviews. 

### Day 4: May 3, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't continue with the Practical JavaScript course due to technical issues with plnkr.co, so instead I continued with the Basic JavaScript section on #FreeCodeCamp just to refresh my memory on a few concepts. 

**Thoughts:** Not my most productive day.

### Day 5: May 4, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Practical JavaScript course and finished watching a Udacity webinar "Front-end Problem Solving and Debugging Skills with Cameron Pittman". Also read this noteworthy [article](https://medium.com/@samerbuna/the-mistakes-i-made-as-a-beginner-programmer-ac8b3e54c312) about Mistakes beginner programmers make and how to avoid them. 

### Days 6 & 7: May 5 & 6, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday I didn't get to dedicate 1 hour to coding, so I guess I already failed to do the 100 days streek. BUT today I dedicated more time to coding than yesterday to make up for it. Got to 82% on the Practical Javascript course. Got a better grasp at using functions inside other functions.

**Thoughts:** Even thought I failed the challenge on day 6, I still pushed myself to learn a bit on SoloLearn (doing the CSS course there), if I wasn't doing this challenge I probably wouldn't have thought about coding that day. 

### Day 8: May 7, 2018 
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: I'm now 90% into the Practical Javascript course. Understood how we distinguish between Higher Order Functions from the Callback Functions, when we have functions inside other functions.

I now truly understand how event listeners work and how the object and it's properties can be acessed when passing a parameter (ex. event) to the  callback function, for example: 
```
// In Chrome dev tools, when an element is selected on a page you can access it by using $0;
var selectedElement = $0;
  selectedElement.addEventListener ('click', function(event) {
  console.log(event);  
  });
// When that selected element is clicked, the mouseEvents object, which has many useful properties, is logged to the console.
``` 
I also learned about event delegation and why it is preferable to do that opposed to adding multiple of the same event listeners to every child.

**Thoughts:** Today I felt like I learned many new things that are small but important to fully understand JavaScript. Also, the todo list is now a bit more functional. 

### Day 9: May 8, 2018 
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Practical JavaScript Course. Continued with freecodecamp lessons and started a new small project a 'Mad Libs - Harry Potter edition', just for fun. By started I mean: Having the idea, creating the files and starting to write a bit of the HTML and CSS. 

**Thoughts:** The PJS course was pretty good for consolidating my previous knowledge of JS and also for understanding how some methods work and most importantly using the Chrome dev tools & debugger both for understanding what is happening and for fixing issues with the code. The last part of the course still needs reviewing though.

### Day 10: May 9, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the design, content and figuring out how to go about the functionality of the Mad Libs Harry Potter project. 

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I'll hopefully get some of the JS code done and working! Fingers crossed.

### Day 11: May 10, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building 

**Today's Progress**: Made input text live change the text on the page. Learned the difference between using ```getElementsByClassName("className")``` and ```querySelector(".className")``` - so the difference is, when you use ``` getElementsByClassName("className")```  it creates a nodeList (a special array of Nodes) of all elements in the page with that class name, so you'd have to use [0] after the () to correctly use that element. Thanks Google and SlackOverflow! 

**Thoughts:** I got so frustrated because I spent over an hour trying to make a single input change an elemnet on the page, when I hadn't loaded the js file correctly! TYPOS :( 
On top of that I'm feeling the flu coming my way!

### Day 12: May 11, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building 

**Today's Progress**: Practically finished the "Harry Potter Mad Libs" project!

**Thoughts:** Even though I was feverish I got to work on the project all day and it felt awesome to actually make progress for once! Might not be the ideal and most readable code ever but I tried to come up with everything on my own. 

### Day 13: May 12, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Testing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: I don't know how finished it is but I feel like it's at a good enough state that I can finish my Mad Libs project with the world!

- Continued with Free Code Camp JS lessons

**Thoughts:** Since yesterday I spent the whole day in front of the computer I made sure not to do that today, but I managed to stay productive with the little time I had planned for coding which is awesome. [Promodoro - Tomato Timer](https://tomato-timer.com/) for the win!
