# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Doing the Practical JavaScript course on Watch and Code. Starting the HTML and DOM section today! I've been doing this course because I want to refresh my memory about JavaScript and really learn to think like a programmer to prepare me for future projects. This course has been recommended to me and it's very good so far. 

**Thoughts:** Got through some exercises that really helped me understand things I hadn't understood before. 
- How objects and primitives compare and how they're stored in variables.

<p>In this example myHouse.color would not change to red.</p>
