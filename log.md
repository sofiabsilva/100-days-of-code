# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 30, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Doing the Practical JavaScript course on Watch and Code. Starting the HTML and DOM section today! I've been doing this course because I want to refresh my memory about JavaScript and really learn to think like a programmer to prepare me for future projects. This course has been recommended to me and it's very good so far. 

**Thoughts:** Got through some exercises that really helped me understand things I hadn't before. 
- How objects and primitives compare and how they're stored in variables.

Example: Here, the object's house color would not change to red! Using these diagrams helped to see the difference between primitive and reference values!

### Day 2: May 1, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the Practical JavaScript course. Learned a very useful tool that will surely help me with all of my projects. THE DEBUGGER! 

**Thoughts:** It's incredible how most javaScript courses don't teach how to actually apply it. Understanding how to interact with the HTML document is so important and so is understanding the chrome dev tools.  


### Day 3: May 2, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: I'm now at 72% on the Practical JavaScript course. Learned about refactoring, something I had never heard of before, all about making the code more readable and organized for humans! Also, not entirely related to coding but I got to watch a webinar titled "Acing Your Interview with Positive Psychology: Q&A with Nico Rose" by Dr. Nico Rose. A perks of being a Google Scholarship alumni!

**Thoughts:** 
About the webinar, I enjoyed it a lot. I've been very interested in Psychology recently (for about a year or so) and there are some tips that I'm going to try to calm myself and prepare for future job interviews. 

### Day 4: May 3, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't continue with the Practical JavaScript course due to technical issues with plnkr.co, so instead I continued with the Basic JavaScript section on #FreeCodeCamp just to refresh my memory on a few concepts. 

**Thoughts:** Not my most productive day.

### Day 5: May 4, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Practical JavaScript course and finished watching a Udacity webinar "Front-end Problem Solving and Debugging Skills with Cameron Pittman". Also read this noteworthy [article](https://medium.com/@samerbuna/the-mistakes-i-made-as-a-beginner-programmer-ac8b3e54c312) about Mistakes beginner programmers make and how to avoid them. 

### Days 6 & 7: May 5 & 6, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday I didn't get to dedicate 1 hour to coding, so I guess I already failed to do the 100 days streek. BUT today I dedicated more time to coding than yesterday to make up for it. Got to 82% on the Practical Javascript course. Got a better grasp at using functions inside other functions.

**Thoughts:** Even thought I failed the challenge on day 6, I still pushed myself to learn a bit on SoloLearn (doing the CSS course there), if I wasn't doing this challenge I probably wouldn't have thought about coding that day. 

### Day 8: May 7, 2018 
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: I'm now 90% into the Practical Javascript course. Understood how we distinguish between Higher Order Functions from the Callback Functions, when we have functions inside other functions.
![](https://s9.postimg.cc/3td31e5lb/Captura_de_ecr_de_2018-05-07_13-31-44.png)

I now truly understand how event listeners work and how the object and it's properties can be acessed when passing a parameter (ex. event) to the  callback function, for example: 
```
// In Chrome dev tools, when an element is selected on a page you can access it by using $0;
var selectedElement = $0;
  selectedElement.addEventListener ('click', function(event) {
  console.log(event);  
  });
// When that selected element is clicked, the mouseEvents object, which has many useful properties, is logged to the console.
``` 
I also learned about event delegation and why it is preferable to do that opposed to adding multiple of the same event listeners to every child.

**Thoughts:** Today I felt like I learned many new things that are small but important to fully understand JavaScript. Also, the todo list is now a bit more functional. 

### Day 9: May 8, 2018 
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Practical JavaScript Course. Continued with freecodecamp lessons and started a new small project a 'Mad Libs - Harry Potter edition', just for fun. By started I mean: Having the idea, creating the files and starting to write a bit of the HTML and CSS. 

**Thoughts:** The PJS course was pretty good for consolidating my previous knowledge of JS and also for understanding how some methods work and most importantly using the Chrome dev tools & debugger both for understanding what is happening and for fixing issues with the code. The last part of the course still needs reviewing though.

### Day 10: May 9, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the design, content and figuring out how to go about the functionality of the Mad Libs Harry Potter project. 

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I'll hopefully get some of the JS code done and working! Fingers crossed.

### Day 11: May 10, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building 

**Today's Progress**: Made input text live change the text on the page. Learned the difference between using ```getElementsByClassName("className")``` and ```querySelector(".className")``` - so the difference is, when you use ``` getElementsByClassName("className")```  it creates a nodeList (a special array of Nodes) of all elements in the page with that class name, so you'd have to use [0] after the () to correctly use that element. Thanks Google and SlackOverflow! 

**Thoughts:** I got so frustrated because I spent over an hour trying to make a single input change an elemnet on the page, when I hadn't loaded the js file correctly! TYPOS :( 
On top of that I'm feeling the flu coming my way!

### Day 12: May 11, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building 

**Today's Progress**: Practically finished the "Harry Potter Mad Libs" project!

**Thoughts:** Even though I was feverish I got to work on the project all day and it felt awesome to actually make progress for once! Might not be the ideal and most readable code ever but I tried to come up with everything on my own. 

### Day 13: May 12, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Testing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: I don't know how finished it is but I feel like it's at a good enough state that I can finish my Mad Libs project with the world! I then continued with a few Free Code Camp JS lessons as well.


[![harry-potter-mad-libs.png](https://s9.postimg.cc/68x13aq67/harry-potter-mad-libs.png)](https://sofiabsilva.github.io/mad-libs-harry-potter/)

**Thoughts:** Since yesterday I spent the whole day in front of the computer I made sure not to do that today, but I managed to stay productive with the little time I had planned for coding which is awesome. [Promodoro - Tomato Timer](https://tomato-timer.com/) for the win! 

### Day 14: May 13, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Reviewing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: Almost done reviewing the freeCodeCamp JS basics. 

**Thoughts:** I much prefer the format of the Udacity lessons or building things myself, but my goal with freeCodeCamp is to get a refresher on the basics and move on to the advanced Udacity courses, then doing their Algorithms & Projects to get the Front End Dev certification. I wonder if I should be doing this? I just felt so insecure about my JS abilities that I wanted to take on the beginner courses and learn more from different resources before getting myself into more advanced stuff. But I'm finding that I know a lot more than I thought I did, which is a good thing obviously!

### Day 15: May 14, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Reviewing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the FCC JS lessons. Now I know what JSON refers to! Had been hearing about it for a long time but never really looked it up (well, at this stage I still won't need to use it but it's nice to know what it is). 

**Thoughts:** It's getting tricky to do the challenges, this last one really got me... It was the "Profile Lookup" one, the whole accessing objects with arrays on them and using nested loops and if else statements is really challenging.  

### Day 16: May 15, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Reviewing

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Javascript Lessons on FCC. Started "Javascript and the DOM" on Udacity. Also learned how to [make folders](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Creating-new-folders-in-GitHub-repository-via-the-browser) in GitHub from the web browser interface, now I'm saving specific lessons/challenges from FCC for later reference.

**Thoughts:**  It was a good decision to take a look at the Udacity course, now I understand where specific methods and properties came from [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).

### Day 17: May 16, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Planing & Learning

**Today's Progress**: I'm planing/designing my website for Tubbie Arts (for displaying my artwork) - basically it's going to be a custom wordpress theme. So It's gonna be a portfolio website that's a bit more elaborate than the one I've created before (this one will have different pages, and offer the ability to purchase my work). I'm learning more about Wordpress as well. Not so much actual coding today but as I learned previously planning should be part of the workflow of a programmer.

### Day 18: May 17, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't manage to do much. Only started writing the html and organizing sections for the Tubbie Arts website and looked for inspiration and cool ways to make a slideshow for the gallery. 

**Thoughts:** I think there is going to be a key thing missing from the aesthetic of the first version of the website at least, which is the lack of good quality photos of my drawings. Need to take new ones but I don't have a good camera! :sweat: 

### Day 19: May 18, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my gallery website, still no gallery to be seen but the design, menu, css and social media links are looking good-ish. 

**Thoughts:** Absolutely loving the pattern I'm using for the background. Found it on https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/

### Day 20: May 19, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the mobile version of the site (mobile first!) got the mobile menu working, wrote and designed the about page, got the portuguese version of the home and about page done.

**Thoughts:** I've been playing with the border-style properties, don't know if it will stay this way but I think it's interesting that you can use two types of styles in a single image (well actually we can use 4). 

![wip about tubbie arts page](https://s9.postimg.cc/5llt5yazz/about-wip.png)

### Day 21: May 20, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Just improved a few things on the design of the pages, made the thumbnails for the featured drawings and made the desktop nav bar appear (I started with the mobile version only). 

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately I didn't get the gallery working yet, I'm still weighting options for what to do with the gallery, link to another page when clicking on the thumbnails (where you can see bigger photo(s) of the drawing, information about it and prices for different sizes of prints to purchase? A paypal link for it? Or a simple lightbox type of gallery with the bigger pictures of the drawings with title, simple description and a link to buy it right there?  Now that I've written this out I think it'll be better to have individual pages for each drawing! This whole journaling thing is a great way to have a conversation with myself and clearly see the pros and cons of my ideas. 

### Day 22: May 21, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Using [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) implemented some smooth transitions between pages, made gallery overlay effect using [this example](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) as a guide.

**Thoughts:**  I feel so limited when it comes to JavaScript, I wonder how long till I feel confident enough to make my ideas come to life just like I imagined them. Well, it's not only JS, with CSS there are many things I still haven't understood... One of them is the absolute and relative positioning, and the other is the ::before and ::after things.

### Day 23: May 22, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Made a cross icon appear when closing the menu on mobile, added a new page for pricing and started working on it's content. 

### Day 24: May 23, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website 

**Today's Progress**: Continued styling the new pricing page (mainly the pricing table) with CSS and made a new (and last) page, which holds the contact form.

**Thoughts:** Will need to learn how to make the contact form work later on! Hope it's not too complicated... :anguished:
Also, I have Web Designer magazines at home and forgot all about them (they're my dad's)! Even though they're not very recent, most stuff is still up to date. So Yay for learning from a non screen medium. 

### Day 25: May 24, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Added icons and an active state to the nav bar, kept styling and updated some of the pages to match the others. Also updated my portfolio with the "Mad Libs" HP game.  

**Thoughts:** Note to self, before making a new page with the same content but with a different language make sure to be done (if it can ever be) before moving on to the other language pages, it saves time.

### Day 26: May 25, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Got mockup images for the individual pages of each gallery item, started trying them out with photoshop, did a few FreeCodeCamp lessons and continued styling the pages of the site.

**Thoughts:** Spent HOURS looking for frame mockups , found some cool psd ones for free at www.anthonyboyd.graphics ; https://www.freepik.com/ and https://graphicburger.com/ for this reason didn't get to code much.

### Day 27: May 26, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Today I did more design than coding again, had to edit some photos and mockups on photoshop still a lot to work on, my computer is super slow which is not helping.

### Day 28: May 27, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Basically same as yesterday! Still putting things together on photoshop and planing content for the website. Technically no real coding today... I'm aware that I'm failing the challenge but I'll keep going anyway, will add hard coding days after the 100th.

### Day 29: May 28, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**:  Continued working with photoshop. Started looking on how to publish my website without back-end knowledge. Watched tutorials on how to create wordpress themes and read a bunch of articles.

**Thoughts:** I [asked for advice on what to do on twitter](https://twitter.com/TubbieHead/status/1001137875155550208), as I was thinking of converting my files into a wordpress theme and then use it's plugins and database. And got a bunch of interesting opinions:

  - Use wordpress!  It's used so widely there are endless resources to learn from. Look up running wordpress locally using xampp or something and go from there.

  - Wordpress can be clunky to build custom with as a noob.
  
  - Learn a back end technology, it will open many doors. There’s a lot to learn but you can do so much with it.
  
  - Try @GoHugoIO if you want to focus only on frontend and dont want to get into other stuff right now.
  
  - Try FireBase! Hosting is free and easy to set up. WordPress might be worth learning, but it can also be a great hassle.

### Day 30: May 29, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**:  Spent most of the day looking into the different suggestions given yesterday and learning about basics of how to publish a website, what's hosting, servers etc. Also started looking into SEO techinques to apply when developing websites and pushed the website I've been working on to [this github repo](https://github.com/sofiabsilva/tubbie-arts-website), added some content to it as well.

**Thoughts:** Realised I was over complicating things. I already have a domain name and can host the site through my dad's host. I don't need any static site generator or CMS for this website since I'm the only one who'll be working on it.

### Day 31: May 30, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning & Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: I didn't make much progress today, just continuing to study SEO and work a bit on my website.

**Thoughts:** A month has passed and I feel like I've learnt a lot and acomplished a bunch of my goals since the start of the challenge. 

### Day 32: May 31, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on my website today, not much to report on... Just Added a new page and made the existing ones and new one more responsive.

**Thoughts:** I got a commission for a pet portrait, so I'm excited about that but also worried that it's going to leave me with little time to code. I'll always try to squeeze in an hour at least, but I bet there won't be much to report on.

### Day 33: June 1, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Kept adding pages & images to website. Finally all pages exist!

### Day 34: June 2, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the individual drawing pages, now started adding fitting descriptions.

**Thoughts:** Still need to see if the pricing is all correct, and look up what's the best paper and way to sell prints. Found out that I can add a shopping cart feature that goes directly to paypal, also seems like you can add shipping costs etc. But have to look more into that.

### Day 35: June 3, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Added ads for print studio where I'll get my prints done to every page, kept learning about the paypal business account.

### Day 36: June 4, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Add the paypal shopping cart integration to one of the pages (even though I don't have a business account yet, this is just a test at the moment). 

**Thoughts:** When is this going to end? I'm probably never gonna be 100% happy with the site, so now I just gotta re-check everything, work a bit more on the content and make sure things actually work.

### Day 37: June 5, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from working on the site, started the new lessons on freecodecamp, also watched a few webinars about career and e-commerce shops. Started my commissioned pet portrait.

**Thoughts:** I would count this day as a miss in terms of coding, but you gotta do what you gotta do right?

### Day 38: June 6, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Learned about CSS variables on freecodecamp.

### Day 39: June 7, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Continued the FCC lessons, it's mostly revision but I got a better understanding of relative and absolute positioning now.

### Day 40: June 8, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Created and translated portuguese page for the lynx drawing, added the portuguese version for the gallery and contact form too.

### Day 41: June 9, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to make the contact form work, will be using formspree for right now. But to upload photos I'll have to use an add on (all info is on formspree.io).

### Day 42: June 10, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: #FreeCodeCamp day! Got to learn how to make shapes and draw with CSS. 

### Day 43: June 12, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Unfortunately missed a day yesterday, but today I've learned how to make animations using keyframes! Pretty cool stuff! Finished the applied visual design section on #freecodecamp

### Day 44 & 45: June 13 & 14, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and building Tubbie Arts website

**Today's Progress**: Started the Applied Accessibility lessons on FCC and am appllying the learned principles to the website.

**Thoughts:** I'm finding this section very informative and interesting, learning so much! Will start to pay more attention to the design from now on, specially color choices. Will also have to tweak some of my older projects in regards to that.

### Day 46: June 15, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and building

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Applied Accessibility lessons on FCC and started working on the survey project. Already passed all the tests with HTML, so the fun part is coming up next! I'll try not to spend too much time choosing the color scheme...

### Day 47: June 16, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Survey project complete! [view on codepen](https://codepen.io/Tubbie/live/RJLpJL) or check [this](https://github.com/sofiabsilva/Survey-FCC) repo.

### Day 48: June 17, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Started building the Product Landing Page, another one of the required projects on FCC. HTML done. CSS next :D

### Day 49: June 18, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the product landing page #freeCodeCamp project. I still struggle to get headers with a logo on the left and a nav-bar on the right to display correctly. 

**Thoughts:** Twitter to the rescue! Sasha sent me this in response to my tweet, it's going to be good to compare the way it's made to what I have https://codepen.io/anon/pen/OEzXeN

### Day 50: June 19, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on the FCC Product Landing Page project. Planning to finish it tomorrow or maybe later today if I have time.
 -Header ✔️
- 1st section ✔️
- color scheme & basic design ✔️

**Thoughts:** I'm halfway through the challenge! IS THIS REAL? I'm happy I started this, but I gotta say having to write my progress on here and twitter is a bit time comsuming, yet it also motivates me to get stuff done each day. 

### Day 51: June 20, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Done with the Product Landing Page - #FreeCodeCamp project, except I still need to add a mobile friendly navigation burger, this will be a task for tomorrow.

![](https://postimg.cc/image/gez29l2dj/)

### Day 52: June 21, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Couldn't do a lot today, but worked on the mobile version of the Product Landing Page, here it is on codepen:
https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/MXObze/

**Thoughts:** I hadn't actually tested the page on a real mobile, now I just saw how it looks on my phone and it's not displaying the burger icon correctly! Ooops. Also, as I'm writing this on another computer, which has a larger monitor, I'm seeing that there are still some things left to change on the page. I'd like to add more animations. 

### Day 53: June 22, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning/ Reviewing

**Today's Progress**: Didn't get to the computer the whole day so I reserved an hour and a half in the morning to use my phone instead and continued with the CSS Fundamentals course through the SoloLearn app.

### Day 54: June 23, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Fixing Stuff and Learning

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some design elements, animations (actually discovered you can't animate a color gradient background in CSS, after spending a good ammount of time refreshing and trying to catch my non-existent mistake) and the mobile non-responsiveness that I had done before on the [FCC Product Landing Page project](https://codepen.io/Tubbie/full/MXObze/), also continued with the sololearn app.

**Thoughts:** Had an idea yesterday as I was listeing to the Syntax podcast, and so that I don't forget I'll write it here: It would be cool to keep up with bugs that take me a lot of time to solve and have a git repo or something like a blog where I post those bugs (even the missing semicolons and dumb mistakes that happen) and my process of solving them and understanding why/how they happen. 

### Day 55: June 24, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and Building

**Today's Progress**: Got to make some progress on #SoloLearn and started working on the remaining #freecodecamp responsive web design project "Technical Documentation Page" I'm doing one for the CSS Animations.

### Day 56: June 25, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and Building

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the FCC Technical Documentation Page project for a bit and then later got through some more CSS3 lessons on sololearn.
